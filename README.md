# Visualization-using-Seaborn

WHAT IS SEABORN?

Seaborn is a data visualization library of python. Using seaborn we can draw attractive and informative graphics for statistical analysis. Seaborn is based on matplotlib, another data visualization library of python.

You may like to ask if we already have matplotlib, why we need additional library seaborn for data visualization. The answer is seaborn works with data frames relatively easier than matplotlib as it is closely integrated with pandas. Also Seaborn has several high level interfaces and customizable themes which are not present in matplotlib.
